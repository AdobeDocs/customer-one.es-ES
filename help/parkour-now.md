# Nueva experiencia de asistencia al cliente de Adobe

We care about our customers and are working to make it easier to get help from Adobe Customer Support when our customers need assistance. Adobe is enhancing the way you receive customer support for Adobe Analytics, Target, and Audience Manager by streamlining the experience through a single entry support portal, the Adobe Admin Console. This transition will enable greater visibility into your service history and will allow you to request support via phone, Web, and chat all through a common platform. These changes are planned to take place in April 2022.

Seguiremos proporcionando más información a su organización a medida que nos acerquemos a la implementación.

## Más información

Throughout February and March 2022, Adobe will be setting up both the new Support System Administrators and the Customer Support Administrators in this portal.

* Take advantage of case management tools that make it easier to work through support cases with Adobe Customer Support

In addition, Support System Administrators will be able to:
